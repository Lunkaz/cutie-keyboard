My Cutie Keyboard is my own version of the first challenge of [30 days with JavaScript](https://javascript30.com/) of Wes Bos.

My version is diferent of Wes Bos keyboard, instead of being a drum keyboard, my version is with animal sounds and also for its functionality with mouse click and touch screens, not only with the key assigned to each icon.

I made it for my kids, they enjoyed it.
