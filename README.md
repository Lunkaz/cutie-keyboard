[Cutie Keyboard](https://lunkaz.github.io/cutie-keyboard/) is my version of the first challenge of [30 days with JavaScript](https://javascript30.com/) of Wes Bos.

My version is diferent of Wes Bos keyboard, not only because of the differences in aesthetics and sounds (instead of being a drum keyboard, my version is with animal sounds) also for its functionality with the mouse and touch screens, not with the key assigned to each icon only.

I made it for my kids, they enjoyed it.
