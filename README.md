# [Cutie Keyboard](lunkaz.github.io/cutie-keyboard)

Cutie Keyboard is my own version of the first challenge of [30 days with JavaScript](https://javascript30.com/) of Wes Bos.
My Keyboard exercises is diferent of Wes Bos keyboard, no only for the visual differences, but for its functionality with mouse click and touch screens, not only with the key assigned to each icon.
I made it for my kids, they enjoy it.
